# Adversarial-Discriminative-Domain-Adaptation
Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) is a domain adaptation approach that uses adversarial training to align the feature distributions of the source and target domains in an unsupervised setting
 Unlike methods like MMD or CORAL, which focus on direct distribution matching, ADDA leverages a domain discriminator to force target features into the source feature space.

Train a Source Feature Extractor & Classifier:

First, a neural network learns features from the labeled source domain using standard supervised learning.

The classifier is trained only on source domain samples at this stage.

Initialize a Separate Target Feature Extractor:

A separate feature extractor is used for the unlabeled target domain, but it initially does not align with the source domain.

The objective is to adapt this target feature extractor to match the source features.

Adversarial Domain Discriminator Training:

A domain discriminator is introduced to distinguish between source and target features.

The target feature extractor learns to fool the discriminator, making target features look like source domain features.

This adversarial training helps align the target feature space with the source feature space.

Final Classification Using Source-Trained Classifier:

Once adaptation is complete, the target feature extractor produces domain-aligned features, allowing the source-trained classifier to work effectively on the target domain without needing target labels.
